# World Wide Trade Api ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Api-%20v0.0.0-green)

World Wide Trade Api is a Rest Api that creates a link between multiple Minecraft servers, allowing players to trade items by buying or selling. This link is made through this API, which gives the different servers access to a common database.

This Api is to be accessed by a Minecraft server plugin that acts as user interface like [wwtshop](https://github.com/RedRiotTank/wwtshop/tree/master) or any other fork of the repository.
